1)	Computation of the effective refractive index of the rib waveguide using the Effective Index Method (EIM)
2)	Optical fiber analysis under the scalar approximation
3)	Computation of dispersion parameters of the single-mode optical fiber SMF-28 and simulation of Gaussian pulses propagation in frequency domain with FFT. Eye diagrams were used to examine the effect of the transmission rate and the fiber’s length and dispersion on the pulses’ duration.
4)	Study of direct modulation of the laser diode
